export const BOILERPLATE_DESCRIPTION = "I have several boilerplates on my github, but this one is the most useful. " +
	"It's an isomorphic react-redux boilerplate, including window check and redux store hydration. It's based on react-router " +
	"v4 and react-redux-router v4.  ";


export const SCRAPING_DESCRIPTION =
	"This an example web scraper, using python's scrapy and selenium framework. Its a solid bootstrapping project" +
	" because it has to parse a .Net application (santarosa.edu), the majority of which are js triggers, and not raw html. It uses a mix of headless selenium and" +
	" scrapy FormRequest. ";

export const SYNONYMITY_DESCRIPTION =
	"This project is an android app, an api and a python web scraper. The web scraper fetches the english dictionary and its synonyms from dictionary.com and loads them into a database." +

export const AGGRE_DESCRIPTIONS = "A website designed to aggregate a fractured live-streaming market. Currently working with twitch and youtube. Aggre.tv includes a " +

export const HALLA_DESCRIPTION =  "I worked for this company while they were only a food recommendation engine. My work included an android app (which is in alpha), backend webscraping" +
	" and database admin. Almost all of what I wrote was in Java.";

export const SKILLETS_DESCRIPTION= "The website of a cafe in my hometown. I use their site as a tech guinea pig. It currently uses google sheets as a CMS, SSR's and hydrates the" +
	" redux store with data spreadsheets. This is a proof of concept on using spreadsheets as a very easily editable database.";

export const ADAM_DESCRIPTION = "This website was written in react-redux. The github repository also contains the elm website, which is still a work in progress because I" +
	"'m porting react-toolbox to elm. It's hosted on Scaleway, inside a docker container that is reverse proxied by nginx."
